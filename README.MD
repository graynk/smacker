# Smacker

A tool made just for me to make Telegram stickers from game screenshots. Extremely barebones and with broken menu items, forked from my [dead image editor](https://github.com/graynk/sie) which I did not finish. I might tidy it up a bit later, but probably not.

Each tab will spawn two Canvases which will eat up VRAM very quickly, which will lead to funny visual bugs, so run with `-Dprism.maxvram=4G` or something
